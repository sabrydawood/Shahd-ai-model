// The unit the Data Foundry stores and inspects (M3). Every ingested document lands in exactly one
// tier with full provenance, a quality score, a content hash (for exact-dup detection), and an
// embedding (for semantic near-dup / "find similar"). Tiers:
//   Filtered — permissive + passed quality: eligible for training.
//   Raw      — general-web / unverified: kept for INSPECTION ONLY, never trained until licensed.
//   Rejected — non-permissive or low-quality: kept with a reason so the corpus is auditable.

export type Tier = "Filtered" | "Raw" | "Rejected";

// Where a document came from — decides tiering. "owned" = our own repos (trained on regardless of
// license, no third-party risk); "curated" = a general/text dataset we explicitly vetted and approved
// as a whole (OASST, Wikipedia, public-domain books) — its single source-level license is recorded for
// provenance but not re-checked per document; "web-general" is always isolated to Raw.
